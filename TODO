1. What is a trading bot?

A trading bot is a software program that automates buying and selling financial assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies based on pre-defined strategies and rules.

These automated systems can manage portfolios without human intervention, operating 24/7.



Let's make a Bitcoin Trading bot

We'll use investing-algorithm-framework in Python



Step 1: Setup

We need to specify how often our trading bot runs and which market data it's going to use



Step 2: Trading Strategy

We will implement a simple strategy that buys Bitcoin when there is a golden cross between a fast and slow-moving average



Step 3: Backtesting

We will test our strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed in the past Now that we have implemented our trading strategy, we can test it. To test our strategy, we will use the backtesting functionality of the investing algorithm framework.


Step 4: Analyze the Backtest Results

This trading strategy is profitable with a growth rate of 17% on its closed trades.


Step 5: Deploy the Trading Bot

Once we have found a profitable trading strategy, we can deploy the trading app in the cloud.
